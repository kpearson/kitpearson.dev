## Key Findings Summary

### The Winning Formula

**Top sites answer 4 questions in first 10 seconds:**
1. What problem do you solve?
2. For whom?
3. How do I know you can do it?
4. What do I do next?

**Recommended section order:**
1. Hero: Problem → Outcome ($300→$13 cost reduction)
2. Social proof strip (logos or role-based testimonials)
3. Problem expansion (why this matters now)
4. Case study (your 96% reduction story)
5. Primary service (AI Cost Audit)
6. How it works (process transparency)
7. Secondary service (Fractional VP)
8. Who you are (finally)
9. Final CTA (clear next step)

### Critical Success Factors

**Must have:**
- ✅ Problem-first headline (not identity-first)
- ✅ Quantified outcome in hero ($300→$13)
- ✅ Social proof within first scroll
- ✅ Specific mechanism/process
- ✅ Clear CTA with risk reduction

**Must avoid:**
- ❌ "About me" section before services
- ❌ Generic "We help companies..." positioning
- ❌ Multiple competing CTAs
- ❌ FAQ sections
- ❌ Technology logos

### Most Valuable Insights

1. **"NO LEARNING ON YOUR DIME"** (Proactive Logic) - Best risk reduction statement found
2. **Tiered commitment ladder** (Jonathan Stark) - Free → Paid → Community funnel
3. **100% in production guarantee** (Fractional AI) - Inverts industry problem
4. **Standing invitation exception** (Kalzumeus) - Only works with 10+ year reputation
