# Consulting Site Patterns: Cross-Site Synthesis
## Analysis of 10 Competitor Sites

## 1. Most Common Section Order (High-Performing Sites)

**Winning pattern observed in top performers (Jonathan Stark, Fractional AI, Kalzumeus):**

1. **Hero with immediate problem-solution framing** (not generic positioning)
2. **Social proof within first screen** (logos, testimonials, or quantified results)
3. **How it works / Process** (only in sites with clear CTAs)
4. **Detailed testimonials or case studies** (mid-page reinforcement)
5. **Final CTA with risk reduction** (or standing invitation)

**Anti-pattern from low performers** (Brennan Dunn, Nick DiSabato):
- Starting with product/service directory
- Assuming visitor knows who you are
- Burying the value proposition below the fold

**Key insight:** Sites that convert lead with **"here's your problem → here's my solution → proof it works"** in the first 3 seconds. Sites that flop lead with **"here's who I am → here's what I offer"** (ego-first vs. problem-first).

## 2. Best Hero Headline Patterns

**Tier 1 - Problem-Solution Framework (Most Effective):**

- **Jonathan Stark**: Problem headline + solution subheadline structure
  - *Why it works:* Immediately qualifies the visitor and positions the offer as the answer

- **CloudZero**: "Understand and reduce your cloud costs" (active verb + specific outcome)
  - *Why it works:* No ambiguity about what you get

- **Vantage**: "Spreadsheets to sanity" (transformation metaphor)
  - *Why it works:* Visceral before/after that engineers instantly recognize

**Tier 2 - Weak/Vague Positioning:**

- **Philip Morgan**: Featured testimonial as hero (delegating positioning to client)
  - *Why it fails:* Visitor has no context for why this testimonial matters

- **Brennan Dunn**: Product directory with no overarching value prop
  - *Why it fails:* Cognitive overload before establishing trust or relevance

**Tier 3 - Assumes Too Much:**

- **Nick DiSabato**: Minimal directory page
  - *Why it fails:* Only works if 100% of traffic already knows your reputation

- **Kalzumeus**: Exception that proves the rule - "standing invitation" model works ONLY because Patrick has decade+ reputation as patio11

**Best practice:** Use format: `[Verb] + [Specific Outcome] + [For Whom]` OR `[Current Pain] → [Desired State]`

## 3. Trust-Building Mechanics: Solo vs. Enterprise

**Solo/Boutique Consultants (Effective):**

1. **Accessibility signals** (Kai Davis: 95% email response rate)
   - Shows you're approachable, not hiding behind forms

2. **Process transparency** (Jonathan Stark: free diagnostic → book → community funnel)
   - Removes mystery about how to start

3. **Personal narrative** (implied in Kalzumeus standing invitation)
   - "I've been where you are" positioning

4. **Relationship-first CTAs** ("Let's talk" vs. "Buy now")
   - Kai Davis: conversation-oriented language throughout

**Solo Anti-Patterns:**

- **Philip Morgan**: Testimonial without context = missed opportunity to frame expertise
- **Brennan Dunn**: Product dump without "why you need this" = confusing, not credible

**Enterprise/Technical (Effective):**

1. **Quantified outcomes** (Fractional AI: "100% in production", Kalzumeus: "$15M raises attributed")
   - Numbers = credibility at scale

2. **Logo walls** (Fractional AI, CloudZero)
   - "Companies like you trust us"

3. **Third-party validation** (CloudZero: analyst badges)
   - Borrowed authority from Gartner/Forrester

4. **Scale proof** (CloudZero: "$14B managed")
   - Shows capability to handle enterprise complexity

5. **Risk reduction guarantees** (Fractional AI: production guarantee, Proactive Logic: "NO LEARNING ON YOUR DIME")
   - Addresses procurement concerns directly

**Enterprise Anti-Pattern:**

- **Proactive Logic**: 5 CTAs all pointing to calls + zero customer proof = desperation signal
  - Risk reduction headline undermined by lack of evidence anyone hired them

**Key distinction:** Solo consultants need to prove **"I'm worth talking to"** while enterprise needs to prove **"We've done this 100 times at your scale."**

## 4. CTA Language & Placement Patterns

**High-Performing CTA Patterns:**

**Dual-CTA Strategy (Best for technical sites):**
- **Fractional AI**: Buyer CTA + Recruitment CTA
  - *Why it works:* Captures two distinct audiences without diluting message

**Tiered Commitment Ladder (Best for solo consultants):**
- **Jonathan Stark**: Free diagnostic → Paid resource → Community access
  - *Why it works:* Lets visitor self-select commitment level

**Standing Invitation (Only works with massive reputation):**
- **Kalzumeus**: "If you're doing X, reach out"
  - *Why it works:* For Patrick. Would fail for 99% of consultants.

**Failed CTA Patterns:**

1. **CTA Spam (Proactive Logic):** 5 CTAs all saying "book a call"
   - *Why it fails:* Reeks of desperation, no proof they deliver value

2. **Weak/Absent CTAs (Philip Morgan):** Email-based contact with no urgency
   - *Why it fails:* Easy to postpone, no momentum

3. **No CTA (Nick DiSabato, Brennan Dunn):** Assumes visitor will hunt for contact info
   - *Why it fails:* Friction = lost leads

**Best Practice Formula:**

- **Above fold:** Low-commitment CTA ("See how it works" / "Get the guide")
- **Mid-page:** After proof, medium-commitment ("Schedule intro call")
- **Bottom:** After full case, high-commitment ("Start your project")

**Language patterns that work:**
- Problem-aware: "Reduce cloud costs" (CloudZero)
- Transformation: "Spreadsheets to sanity" (Vantage)
- Dialogue: "Let's talk about..." (Kai Davis)

**Language that fails:**
- Generic: "Contact us"
- Ego: "Hire me"
- Vague: "Learn more"

## 5. "How It Works" Section Patterns

**Present in high performers:**

- **Jonathan Stark**: Clear 3-step funnel (diagnostic → resource → community)
- **CloudZero**: Implied in "free trial" flow (common SaaS pattern)
- **Vantage**: Freemium onboarding (self-serve start)

**Absent in low performers:**

- **Philip Morgan**: No process = unclear how to start
- **Nick DiSabato**: Directory only = assumes you already know
- **Brennan Dunn**: Product list without entry point guidance

**Pattern for solo consultants who have it:**
1. "Discovery" (low commitment)
2. "Deep dive" (paid diagnostic/workshop)
3. "Engagement" (retainer/project/community)

**Pattern for technical consultants:**
1. "Assessment" (audit/analysis)
2. "Implementation" (hands-on delivery)
3. "Handoff" or "Ongoing support"

**Why it matters:** Sites without "how it works" create **decision paralysis**. Visitor thinks: "This sounds good, but... what do I actually DO next?"

**Best implementation:**
- **Jonathan Stark**: Explicit funnel with clear entry point (free → paid)
- **Fractional AI**: Implied through dual CTAs (hire us / join us)
- **Kalzumeus**: Standing invitation = process is "just email me" (only works with reputation)

## 6. What Top Sites Do That Mediocre Ones Skip

**Top performers systematically include:**

1. **Quantified outcomes in first screen**
   - Fractional AI: "100% in production"
   - Kalzumeus: "$15M raises attributed"
   - CloudZero: "$14B managed"
   - **Missing from:** Philip Morgan, Nick DiSabato, Brennan Dunn, Proactive Logic

2. **Problem-solution framing before identity**
   - Jonathan Stark: Your problem → My solution
   - Vantage: "Spreadsheets to sanity"
   - **Inverse (fails):** Brennan Dunn product directory, Nick DiSabato minimal page

3. **Tiered commitment paths**
   - Jonathan Stark: Free → Book → Community
   - Vantage: Freemium → Paid
   - CloudZero: Trial → Demo → Purchase
   - **Missing from:** Proactive Logic (only "book call"), Philip Morgan (only "email me")

4. **Social proof within first scroll**
   - Fractional AI: Logos + testimonials + case studies
   - CloudZero: Analyst badges + customer logos
   - Jonathan Stark: Testimonials embedded in flow
   - **Missing from:** Proactive Logic (zero proof), Brennan Dunn (placeholder content)

5. **Specific mechanism/process**
   - Vantage: "LLM-powered recommendations"
   - Fractional AI: "We deploy, you keep IP"
   - Jonathan Stark: 3-step funnel
   - **Missing from:** Philip Morgan (unclear how you work together), Nick DiSabato (no process)

6. **Risk reduction language**
   - Fractional AI: "100% in production" guarantee
   - Proactive Logic: "NO LEARNING ON YOUR DIME" (undermined by zero proof)
   - Kalzumeus: "Standing invitation" = low pressure
   - **Missing from:** Brennan Dunn, Nick DiSabato, Philip Morgan

## The Real Patterns That Matter

### What Separates Winners from Losers:

**Winners answer 4 questions in first 10 seconds:**
1. What problem do you solve? (Problem framing)
2. For whom? (Audience qualification)
3. How do I know you can do it? (Proof)
4. What do I do next? (Clear CTA)

**Losers assume you already know:**
- Who they are (ego-first positioning)
- Why you're there (no problem framing)
- What to do next (weak/absent CTAs)

### The Solo Consultant Trap:

**Philip Morgan, Nick DiSabato, Brennan Dunn all fail the same way:**
- Assume reputation precedes them
- Lead with identity/catalog instead of problem
- No clear entry point for new visitors
- Weak or absent CTAs

**Only Kai Davis escapes this trap:**
- Explicitly accessible ("95% response rate")
- Relationship-first language
- Clear process implied through CTA language

### The Enterprise Playbook (Works Every Time):

1. Logos above the fold
2. Quantified outcomes within first screen
3. Risk reduction guarantee
4. Multiple case studies/testimonials
5. Clear "how it works" or "get started" flow

**Fractional AI and CloudZero execute this perfectly. Proactive Logic attempts it but fails due to zero social proof.**

### The Kalzumeus Exception:

Patrick McKenzie's "standing invitation" model **only works because:**
- Decade+ of public writing as patio11
- "$15M raises attributed" quantified outcome
- Reputation-first positioning (not replicable for new consultants)

**Any consultant without 10+ years of public reputation who copies this approach will fail.**

---

## Final Takeaway:

**The single biggest differentiator:** Top sites lead with **visitor's problem**, mediocre sites lead with **consultant's identity**.

**Formula that works:**
1. Problem headline
2. Solution subheadline
3. Proof within first scroll
4. Clear next step
5. Tiered commitment options

**Formula that fails:**
1. Generic positioning
2. Product/service directory
3. Assumed reputation
4. Weak/absent CTAs
5. No process/mechanism explained
