# One-Page Consulting Site Blueprint
## For: AI Infrastructure Cost Optimization + Fractional VP Services

## Recommended Section Order

### 1. **Hero Section: The Cost Problem**
**Placement rationale:** Lead with the visitor's bleeding neck (runaway AI costs), not who you are.

**Structure:**
- **Headline:** Direct pain point → outcome promise
  - Pattern: "Your [problem] is [adjective]. Here's the [number]% reduction we delivered."
  - Example direction: "Your AI infrastructure costs are out of control. We cut ours 96%—from $300 to $13 per user."
- **Subhead:** Single-sentence mechanism/proof
  - "Hands-on architecture audit delivered $287/user/month savings in 6 weeks."
- **Single CTA:** "See the case study" or "Get your cost audit"

**Steal from:**
- Problem-outcome headline structure (no identity fluff)
- Quantified outcome in first 10 words

**Skip entirely:**
- Generic "We help companies..." positioning
- Your photo/bio in hero
- Multiple CTAs competing for attention

---

### 2. **Social Proof Strip**
**Placement rationale:** Credibility immediately after bold claim, before visitor bounces.

**Structure:**
- **One-liner:** "Trusted by engineering leaders at:"
- **3-5 logos OR role-based testimonials** if no logos yet
  - If no clients: Use roles: "VP Engineering, Series B SaaS" + "CTO, PE-backed Fintech"

**Steal from:**
- Minimal, non-distracting logo bars
- Monochrome, understated presentation

**Skip entirely:**
- Generic stock testimonials ("Great to work with!")
- Over-designed testimonial carousels
- Awards/certifications (nobody cares)

---

### 3. **The Problem Section: Why This Matters Now**
**Placement rationale:** Expand the wound. Make them feel the urgency before you present solutions.

**Structure:**
- **Headline:** "AI costs are eating your margin"
- **3 pain points in visitor's language:**
  - "Your LLM bill doubled this quarter with no corresponding revenue increase"
  - "Your team is shipping features, but your AI spend per user keeps climbing"
  - "You suspect you're overpaying, but have no visibility into why"
- **No CTA here** (just build tension)

**Steal from:**
- Concrete, specific pains (not generic "challenges")
- Systemic problem framing (not user failure)

**Skip entirely:**
- Generic "challenges" or "pain points" language
- Anything that sounds like you made it up vs. heard from buyers

---

### 4. **The Case Study: Your 96% Reduction**
**Placement rationale:** Peak attention. Give them the proof before offering services.

**Structure:**
- **Headline:** "How we cut AI costs 96% without sacrificing quality"
- **Before/After visual:**
  - "$300/user/month → $13/user/month"
  - "6-week engagement, $287/month savings per user"
- **3-4 bullet mechanism:**
  - "Audited prompt engineering patterns wasting tokens"
  - "Migrated 80% of requests to cheaper models with A/B testing"
  - "Implemented caching layer reducing API calls 60%"
  - "Rightsized context windows based on actual usage"
- **CTA:** "Apply this to your infrastructure"

**Steal from:**
- Specific tactics (not vague strategy)
- Technical but accessible presentation

**Skip entirely:**
- Hiding the mechanism (you want to prove you know how, not hoard secrets)
- Vague "optimization" language
- Over-designed infographics

---

### 5. **Service #1: AI Infrastructure Cost Audit (Primary Offering)**
**Placement rationale:** Now they believe you. Present the primary offering.

**Structure:**
- **Headline:** "Fixed-Fee AI Cost Audit"
- **What they get (deliverable-focused):**
  - "Complete architecture audit of your LLM/AI stack"
  - "Line-item cost breakdown showing exactly where money is going"
  - "Prioritized reduction roadmap with projected savings"
  - "6-week engagement, fixed $X fee"
- **Who it's for:** "Engineering leaders at Series A-C startups spending $50K+/month on AI infrastructure"
- **Single CTA:** "Book audit call"

**Steal from:**
- Deliverable list with clear scope
- Projected savings language (not vague "optimization")

**Skip entirely:**
- Hourly rates or "it depends" pricing language
- "Strategy" or "consulting" positioning (you do hands-on work)
- Listing technologies you work with (irrelevant)

---

### 6. **How It Works: Process Section**
**Placement rationale:** Reduce perceived risk by showing the mechanism.

**Structure:**
- **Headline:** "The audit process"
- **3-step process:**
  1. "Week 1-2: Architecture review + data gathering"
  2. "Week 3-4: Cost analysis + opportunity identification"
  3. "Week 5-6: Roadmap delivery + implementation kickoff"
- **No CTA** (just transparency)

**Steal from:**
- Concrete timeline (no fluff)
- Process transparency builds confidence

**Skip entirely:**
- Vague "discovery → strategy → execution" frameworks
- Over-complicated diagrams
- Anything mentioning "agile" or "iterative"

---

### 7. **Service #2: Fractional VP of Engineering (Secondary)**
**Placement rationale:** After primary offering. For visitors with bigger needs.

**Structure:**
- **Headline:** "Or: Fractional VP of Engineering for AI Transformation"
- **One-paragraph description:**
  - "Leading AI infrastructure + engineering for 10-50 person teams at Series A-C startups. Part-time retainer, full leadership impact."
- **Differentiator:** "Hands-on architecture work, not just management."
- **CTA:** "Discuss fractional leadership"

**Steal from:**
- Minimal, credibility-driven presentation
- Accomplishment-focused positioning

**Skip entirely:**
- Long service descriptions (this is secondary)
- Listing all the things VPs do (they know)
- Competing with primary offering for attention

---

### 8. **Who I Am (Finally)**
**Placement rationale:** Last. They're already convinced; now they want to know who you are.

**Structure:**
- **Headline:** Your name (that's it)
- **3-sentence bio:**
  - "Built and scaled AI products at [companies]"
  - "Reduced my own AI costs 96% in 6 weeks"
  - "Now helping engineering leaders at Series A-C companies do the same"
- **Photo:** Professional, not stiff
- **No CTA** (they've already seen CTAs)

**Steal from:**
- Credibility without ego
- Accomplishment-driven narrative

**Skip entirely:**
- Long career history
- Personality fluff ("passionate about...")
- Listing every technology you've ever used

---

### 9. **Final CTA Section**
**Placement rationale:** Clear next step for those who scrolled to the end.

**Structure:**
- **Headline:** "Ready to cut your AI costs?"
- **Two-path CTA:**
  - Primary: "Book cost audit call"
  - Secondary: "Email me: your@email.com"
- **Risk reduction:** "30-minute call, no obligation. We'll assess if this makes sense for you."

**Steal from:**
- Low-pressure, human tone
- Email as CTA option (reduces friction)

**Skip entirely:**
- Newsletter signup (too low commitment)
- "Schedule a demo" language (this isn't a product)
- Contact forms (friction)

---

## What to Skip Entirely (Common Mistakes)

1. **"About" section before services** (nobody cares who you are until they care what you do)
2. **Generic "Our Values" content** (waste of space)
3. **Multiple service tiers on one page** (confusing; you have 2 services, not 5 packages)
4. **FAQ section** (if you need this, your copy isn't clear enough)
5. **Blog/Resources section** (different goal; keep this pure conversion)
6. **"Book a call to learn more" without specificity** (what kind of call? for what?)
7. **Stock photos of handshakes/offices** (dated, destroys credibility)
8. **Technology logos "We use..."** (irrelevant to buyer)

## Specific Mechanics to Steal

| Mechanic | Application | Where to Use |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Problem → Outcome headline structure | Lead with pain + result | Hero section |
| Quantified case study format | Show specific tactics | Case study section |
| Deliverable-focused service description | Clear scope, no vagueness | Service #1 |
| Timeline-based process | Concrete milestones | How It Works |
| Two-path CTA (high/low commitment) | Multiple entry points | Final CTA |
| Monochrome trust bar | Subtle credibility | Social proof |
| Before/after cost visual | Dramatic numbers | Case study |

---

## Copy Tone Throughout

- **Direct, not clever:** "We cut costs 96%" not "We optimize your AI journey"
- **Specific numbers:** "$300→$13" not "significant savings"
- **Buyer's language:** "Your LLM bill doubled" not "Suboptimal token utilization"
- **Confident, not salesy:** "Book audit call" not "Transform your infrastructure today!"
- **Technical but accessible:** Show you know how, but don't gatekeep with jargon

---

## Final Layout Note

**Single column, no sidebar.** Every section full-width. Visitor scrolls straight down. No competing attention. No "Learn More" links to other pages. One page, one goal: book the call.

---

## Key Patterns from Research

**Winners answer 4 questions in first 10 seconds:**
1. What problem do you solve? (Problem framing)
2. For whom? (Audience qualification)
3. How do I know you can do it? (Proof)
4. What do I do next? (Clear CTA)

**Formula that works:**
1. Problem headline
2. Solution subheadline
3. Proof within first scroll
4. Clear next step
5. Tiered commitment options

**The single biggest differentiator:** Top sites lead with **visitor's problem**, mediocre sites lead with **consultant's identity**.
